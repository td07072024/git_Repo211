The forest owlet was recorded in central India, and until 1997 was known from just seven specimens in museums collected in northern Maharashtra, and south-east Madhya Pradesh or western Odisha. The last record until then was based on a specimen claimed from Gujarat in 1914 by Richard Meinertzhagen. Searches in Gujarat had been futile until the species was rediscovered in November 1997 by a group of American ornithologists in the foothills of the Satpura Range, northeast of Bombay.[3][8] The cause of the earlier failed searches was due to the resubmission of a stolen specimen with the falsification of locality data.[9]

The forest owlet was observed in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, and at a few locations in Melghat Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra.[10][11] A survey in 2011 in non-protected areas of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh confirmed the presence of the species at two locations. In Maharashtra, a pair was observed (out of 7 pairs in 2004) in Toranmal Reserve Forest. In Madhya Pradesh, six individuals were observed in Khaknar.[12] In Maharashtra, it was also reported to inhabit the forest ranges of Taloda and Khaknaar.[13]

All these places in central India harbour dense to open deciduous forests with Tectona grandis, Lagerstroemia parvifolia, Boswellia serrata and Lannea grandis trees. Nest cavities were found at a height of 5.0–8.0 m (16.4–26.2 feet) in trees like Soymida febrifuga. In most areas, the trees were too young and lacking cavities suitable for nesting.[14] An individual was sighted in Tansa Wildlife Sanctuary in the Thane district in 2014.[15] It was reported that human disturbed forests with more clearings within the forests were preferred for foraging.[16] In Toranmal Reserve Forest, the forest owlet utilized areas with open canopy and dense undergrowth.[17]

In Gujarat, the forest owlet occurs in Purna Wildlife Sanctuary.
