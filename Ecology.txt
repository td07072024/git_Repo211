The forest owlet typically hunts from perches where it sits still and waits for prey. When perched, it flicks its tail from side to side rapidly and more excitedly when it chases prey. Lizards and skinks constitute nearly 60% of its prey, rodents 15%, birds 2% and the remainder invertebrates and frogs. When nesting, the male hunts and feeds the female at nest, and the female feeds the young. The nestlings fledge after 30–32 days.[19]

A study conducted in the forests of Madhya Pradesh revealed that the forest owlet is a generalist predator that consumes a variety of small mammals.[20]

The peak courtship season is in January and February during which time they are very responsive to call playback with a mixture of song and territorial calls.[14]

The forest owlet appears to be strongly diurnal, although not very active after 10 in the morning; it often hunts during daytime.[8] On cold winter mornings, it basks on top of tall trees.[19]

Filial cannibalism by males has been observed.[21]

Vocalization
They make several different calls, which include a hissing call of short duration. The song calls are short and mellow unlike those of most owls. They are usually disyllabic, "oh-owow" but sound monosyllabic and each note ascends and descends rapidly. The territorial calls have been transcribed as "kwaak … kk, kwaa..kk". A contact call of "kee yah, kee…yah" is given when the male brings food to the female at nest. The alarm call is a "chirrur… chirrur, chirr…chirr", while begging "kee…k, kee…k" calls are made when young or females seek food.
