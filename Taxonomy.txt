Heteroglaux blewitti was the scientific name proposed by Allan Octavian Hume in 1873 who described a female owlet that had been shot near Basna in 1872 by his collaborator Francis Robert Blewitt (born 1815). Hume noted that the head is smaller than in other Athene species and that the lower mandible was more strongly notched. He therefore placed it in a new genus Heteroglaux.[5] Results of a phylogenetic study published in 2018 indicate that it a member of the Athene clade.
